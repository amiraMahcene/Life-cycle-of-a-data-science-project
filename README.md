# Life-cycle-of-a-data-science-project
To comprehend the data science project process, it's helpful to follow a clear approachâ€”this is what we refer to as the data science project lifecycle.

# Data Science
 Data science is a field where we uncover patterns and characteristics within a dataset. It blends mathematics, statistics, and computer science to perform its magic.
# Relationship between Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
 Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are distinct fields. Data science aims to identify patterns and trends for decision-making, while AI focuses on enabling computers to emulate human behavior and intelligence. 
The connection lies in utilizing AI during the development phase of a data science project, specifically in training models through machine learning.
# Machine Learning 
Machine learning, a subset of AI, centers on autonomous learning. This means algorithms or statistical models possess the ability to learn without explicit instructions from an expert. 
In essence, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.
# Deep Learning 
Deep Learning is a facet of Machine Learning that employs artificial neural networks. These models draw inspiration from the structure and function of human behavior.
# Types of Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
  * Supervised Learning == labled dataset, which mean we train algorithm (model) to learn and the relationship between the input(s) and the output (target)
  * Unsupervised Learning == mainly used in grouping the exemples from the data [ clustoring, classification]
  * Reinforcemen Learning == Learn from the basis of the trail and error, By rewarding good choices and punishing bad onces, which enables the model to recognize patterns
# Lifecycele of data science project
The lifecycle of a data science project involves two main phases, each comprising seven steps.

Phase A - Focus on the Best Model: From Business Case to Proof of Concept

In this phase, the primary focus is on developing the optimal model tailored to the specific business case. Understanding the business case is crucial for success. The first phase consists of four key steps:

    Formulate a Strong Business Case
    Acquire Relevant Data
    Clean and Explore the Data
    Develop and Evaluate the Model

Phase B - Focus on Continuity: From Proof of Concept to Scalable End Product

This phase centers around deploying the model effectively. It is divided into three stages:

    Transition from Proof of Concept to Implementation
    Manage the Model in Operation
    Bridge Model Management to the Business Case
  Let's detailed each phase :
  # Phase A : Focus on the Best Model : From business case to proof-of-concept
  * Step 01 :  A good business case
    a valuable data scince project == clear business case
    what we mean by clear business case ? the requirement of the solution of the problem ( the need of the project), the objective of the project that we are looking to achieve, the added value for the organization and how will the information from the algorithm eventually be used?
    to get those answer we have to :
    - involve the end user ( the domain expert ), he is the most one who understand the business case and also the one who gonna use the information generated by the model
    - does AI gives the best solution for the problem? yes AI is so powerful in many fileds but AI has also some limits. So, it is wise to assess whether AI in the form of learning algorithms is the best solution of the program ex : if the tranparency of the algorithm is of great importance, so in such case AI is not the best option because in particular Deep Learning are often difficult to understand why they show certain behaviour/gives such a resulats
* Step 02 : Obtain the correct data
  Developing an AI algorithm often requires large amounts of high quality data, since a flexible model will extract its intelligence from the information contained in the data.
  So, how can you get a correct data
  we have here two phases :
  - in the first phase of the data science lifecylce, a one-off collected data dump is usually sufficient ( on the early stage of data science project,  the focus of understanding the business case project, definding the problem, objective and goals also preparing the necessary data for analysis one-off collected data dump mean just a single dataset all the data scince team working on)
  - In the second phase of data scince lifecycle, once a model becomes operartional, a one-off data dump is no longer sufficient( the data have to be retrived automatically and fed into the model (we have to think on this phase on the 1st phase too to avoid any complexity at the end)
