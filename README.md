# Life-cycle-of-a-data-science-project
To comprehend the data science project process, it's helpful to follow a clear approachâ€”this is what we refer to as the data science project lifecycle.

# Data Science
 Data science is a field where we uncover patterns and characteristics within a dataset. It blends mathematics, statistics, and computer science to perform its magic.
# Relationship between Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
 Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are distinct fields. Data science aims to identify patterns and trends for decision-making, while AI focuses on enabling computers to emulate human behavior and intelligence. 
The connection lies in utilizing AI during the development phase of a data science project, specifically in training models through machine learning.
# Machine Learning 
Machine learning, a subset of AI, centers on autonomous learning. This means algorithms or statistical models possess the ability to learn without explicit instructions from an expert. 
In essence, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.
