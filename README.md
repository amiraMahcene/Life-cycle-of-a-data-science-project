# Lifecycle of a Data Science Project

To comprehend the data science project process, it's helpful to follow a clear approachâ€”this is what we refer to as the data science project lifecycle.
Data Science

Data science is a field where we uncover patterns and characteristics within a dataset. It blends mathematics, statistics, and computer science to perform its magic.
# Relationship between Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are distinct fields. Data science aims to identify patterns and trends for decision-making, while AI focuses on enabling computers to emulate human behavior and intelligence. The connection lies in utilizing AI during the development phase of a data science project, specifically in training models through machine learning.
# Machine Learning

Machine learning, a subset of AI, centers on autonomous learning. This means algorithms or statistical models possess the ability to learn without explicit instructions from an expert. In essence, machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.
# Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a facet of Machine Learning that employs artificial neural networks. These models draw inspiration from the structure and function of human behavior.
# Types of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

    * Supervised Learning == Involves a labeled dataset, where the algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs.
    * Unsupervised Learning == Primarily used in grouping examples from the data (clustering, classification).
    * Reinforcement Learning == Learns through trial and error, rewarding good choices and punishing bad ones, enabling the model to recognize patterns.

# Lifecycle of a Data Science Project

The lifecycle of a data science project involves two main phases, each comprising seven steps.
* Step 01: Formulate a Strong Business Case
A valuable data science project hinges on a clear business case. What we mean by a clear business case includes understanding the problem's solution requirements, the project's objectives, the added value for the organization, and how the algorithm's information will eventually be used. To obtain these answers:

   -  Involve the end user (the domain expert), as they are the ones who understand the business case and will use the information generated by the model.
   - Assess whether AI provides the best solution for the problem. While AI is powerful in many fields, it has limitations. For instance, if algorithm transparency is crucial, AI might not be the best option, especially as Deep Learning can be challenging to interpret.

* Step 02: Obtain the Correct Data
Developing an AI algorithm often requires substantial amounts of high-quality data. A flexible model derives its intelligence from the information within the data. To obtain correct data:

    - In the first phase of the data science lifecycle, a one-off collected data dump is usually sufficient. This occurs in the early stage of the project, where the focus is on understanding the business case, defining the problem, objectives, and goals, and preparing necessary data for analysis. A one-off collected data dump refers to a single dataset that the entire data science team works on.

    - In the second phase of the data science lifecycle, once a model becomes operational, a one-off data dump is no longer sufficient. Data retrieval needs to be automatic, feeding data into the model continuously. It's crucial to consider this phase during the first phase to avoid complexities later on.
